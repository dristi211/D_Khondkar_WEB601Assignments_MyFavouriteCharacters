I am going to develop a single-page application using Angular for this assignment about my favorite characters. One of my favorite characters is Sherlock Holmes Created by Arthur Conan Doyle, the Great Detective made his debut in A Study in Scarlet in 1887, and he became very popular in no time. My second favorite character Alex Trebek, was a Canadian-American game show host and television personality. He is best known for hosting the syndicated general knowledge quiz game show Jeopardy.
